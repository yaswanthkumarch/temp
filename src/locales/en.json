A very popular god among both rural and urban devotees, he is worshiped for various benefits: health, wealth, happiness, fulfillment of desires, success, and magical accomplishments.",
    "paragraph2": "The history behind the name of the temple is as fascinating as Hanuman's Leelas. It is believed that a big heap of Ragi (a food grain) turned into stone, hence the name “Ragigudda”. The temple was constructed in 1969 and has since evolved into a grand complex."
